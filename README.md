# Development
## Running
1. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
2. From the root directory of this project, run:
```
yarn install
```
3. Open scripts/app.js and ensure IS_CORDOVA is set to false
5. Open index.html in a web server, such as [Mongoose](https://cesanta.com/).  
(HINT: Drop Mongoose in the root directory of this project and then just double-click it.)

## Deploying
There's currently no build process; just deploy this entire directory, including node_moduels.  (But you'll probably want to skip the .git folder)

## What about the Android App?
I've used Cordova to package the Android app, but the project isn't really in a state to be released.  I currently have no plans to release the source to it, but if you're really interested feel free to contact me at [ducttape12@yahoo.com](mailto:ducttape12@yahoo.com).
