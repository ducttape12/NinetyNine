    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Ninety-Nine is played with two to five players and a standard 52 card deck. (In this version of Ninety-Nine, only the
        values and effects each card has are displayed in order to simplify the game.) Each player is randomly dealt three
        cards. Players alternate playing cards, adding or subtracting from the Count.</p>
    <p>At no point can the Count exceed 99 nor can it fall below 0. Players who cannot play a card that will keep the Count
        below or equal to 99 are eliminated. The last player remaining is the winner.</p>
    <h3>Playing the Game</h3>
    <p>At the bottom of the screen are your three cards. If the card can be played, it will be bright blue. If it cannot be
        played, it will be a light blue. Tap on the card you wish to play. It will be placed on the game board, its value
        will be added to the count, and its effect will be applied. A new card is automatically drawn for you, and play continues
        clockwise to the next player (unless the order has been reversed).</p>
    <p>If a card can be played in one of many ways, a pop-up will appear near the card. Tap the way you wish to play. Tapping
        anywhere else on the screen will dismiss the pop-up, allowing you to select a different card.</p>
    <p>CPU players will automatically play a card after a slight delay. They will draw another card and play continues clockwise
        to the next player (unless the order has been reversed).</p>
    <p>During the game, if the deck is exhausted, the played cards will be reshuffled. Cards will continue to be drawn from
        this reshuffled deck.</p>
